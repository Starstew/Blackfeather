# Blackfeather
A JavaScript roguelike using ROT.js, started for 7DRL 2015, and inspired by Songgu Kwon's web-comic "Elf".

## Overview
Blackfeather is a fantasy dungeon crawling game in the tradition of Rogue. I started this game as part of the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge 
(7DRL, http://7drl.org) in March 2015. I was able to get a basic engine going in that time, but nothing close to the final game I 
envisioned. As such, this project is very much a work-in-progress.

## Playing the game
Just open the **index.html** in a browser and you're good to go. Use cursor keys (up, down, left, right, etc.) to move around.
The game is simple "bump to attack" right now. Killing monsters accrues experience, which will level you up, which gives you 
more max hit-points and more attack power.

Eating mushrooms adds max hit-points, and heals some hit-points.

Goal of the game, currently, is to obtain the mysterious "Black Feather" from a powerful monster.
