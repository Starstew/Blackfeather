This is just a place to keep notes about things I'd like to do with the game.
=============================================================================

Features:
* NPC reaction to other NPC (packing, hunting, fleeing)
* NPC idle behavior
* Treasure/items in world
* Change equipment
* Upgrade/downgrade weapon
* Stackable items in inventory
* Potions/phials
* Tracking (spoornography)
* Proximity sensing (not just FOV/LOS)
* Damage mitigation based on type of damage, armor, etc.
* Ranged attacks
* Individual names for monsters
* Switching between characters
* Winning condition (retrieve black feather, return to surface)
* Allow going "up" once macguffin found
* Conjuring powers
* Enchantable equipment
* Magic items
* Trajectory items/beings -- have a "pathing" array that dictates movement until end of array. 
	- Slow-flying missiles/spells
	- Charging Minotaurs
	- Patrolling creatures
	- Propelled clouds
* Different types of maps (caverns, rooms, forests)
* 

Coding:
* Monsters' routing should be limited to certain distance, if it can't get to target in x-hops, then get as close as it can(?) or not move? .onNoRouteToTarget?
* Use 'instanceof' (e.g. 'pobj instanceof Monster')
* Data-driven weapons, treasure
* Better way to do handle placement rarity/frequency (better than repeating in array)
* Mix-and-match prototype abilities to add to procgen NPCs (e.g. base Orc, but some have ability to set traps)
* Weapons have "onDamage" and "onKill" hooks


UI:
* Click to select target
* Tooltip system can allow speech bubbles and "info" windows
* Red glow around map when health is low
* Game over screen (rather than Alert)
