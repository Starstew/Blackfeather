* Better way to do handle placement rarity/frequency (better than repeating in array)

* Weapons have "onDamage" and "onKill" hooks
- When routing, consider impassable-object occupied spaces as blockers
- Impose some pause between "presses" so turns are weightier


UI:

* Red glow around map when health is low
* Game over screen (rather than Alert)
